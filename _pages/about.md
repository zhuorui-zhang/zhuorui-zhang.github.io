This is Zhuorui Zhang's personal homepage. Please also refer to my [homepage@UNSW](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-ze-jiang). 

## A short introduction
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering's [Water Research Centre@UNSW](https://www.wrc.unsw.edu.au/) working in the field of hydro-climatology. I received my Ph.D. in Water Resource Engineering from UNSW. During my Ph.D., I developed a new method, namely Wavelet System Prediction (WASP), which is able to predict sustained hydro-climatological changes. I received my B.Eng. in Environmental Engineering from Hohai University, China; I did my Joint M.Sc., named “EuroAquae - HydroInformatics and Water Management” under a partnership of five European universities (in Barcelona, Budapest, Cottbus, Newcastle/UK, and Nice). Before moving to Australia, I also worked in hydrological and crop modelling at Tropical Marine Science Institute of National University of Singapore for two years.

<b>Research Interests:</b>
* Hydro-climatological modelling and forecasting
* Climate change impact on the water cycle (e.g. floods and droughts)
* Hydrology/Hydraulics and water quality numerical modelling
* HydroInformatics and water management

<b>Research Highlights:</b>
* Development of [spectral transformation](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026962) and its [application](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126816) in hydro-climatology
* An open-source tool for improved system modelling: [Wavelet System Prediction (WASP)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104907)
* Quantification of future changes in drought and [agricultural production](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-018-2617-z) under global warming
* Development of [index-based drought insurance](https://doi.org/10.1108/AFR-02-2020-0020) for disaster risk transfer
