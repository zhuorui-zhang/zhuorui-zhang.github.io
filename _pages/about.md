This is Zhuorui Zhang's personal homepage.

## A short introduction
I'm an Algorithm Engineering in the Autonomous Driving Center of XPeng Motors. I received my Master degree in Applied Mathematics and Data Science from Macau University of Science and Technology. I received my B.Eng. in Materials Science and Engineering from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/).

<b>Research Interests:</b>
* Machine Learning and Deep Learning
* Autonomous driving algorithms
* Multi-sensor Fusion

<b>Research Highlights:</b>
<!-- * Development of [spectral transformation](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026962) and its [application](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126816) in hydro-climatology
* An open-source tool for improved system modelling: [Wavelet System Prediction (WASP)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104907)
* Quantification of future changes in drought and [agricultural production](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-018-2617-z) under global warming
* Development of [index-based drought insurance](https://doi.org/10.1108/AFR-02-2020-0020) for disaster risk transfer -->
